# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: A function is a custom algorithm that is meant to determine a specific outcome when giving data. The algorithm should be able manipulate data entered. 
  Researched answer: 

A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output

2. What is the difference between .map() and .filter()?

  Your answer: .map() takes in an array and returns another array that is the same length and the .filter() returns a subset of the array and has an if statement built-in which needs to have a return. 

  Researched answer:
filter()
The filter() method creates an array filled with all array elements that pass a test implemented by the provided function. The filter method is well suited for particular instances where the user must identify certain items in an array that share a common characteristic
map()
The map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a function for every array element. The map method allows items in an array to be manipulated to the userâ€™s preference, returning the conclusion of the chosen manipulation in an entirely new array.


3. What is the difference between console.log() and return?

  Your answer: A console.log() is a way to check your work through a back end gui meant for the developer and a return should be the outcome of a function that I believe ties into the front end user experience. 
 
  Researched answer:

Return is the result a subroutine, or function, will return, and console.log is a way to log to the "console" where available. The console is a destination made available by certain browsers that enables Javascript programmers to stream text to an output e.g logging.

4. In regards to functions, what is an argument?

  Your answer: In regards to a function, the argument is the data that you would input to run through the designed algorithm example would be a primitive data type or an array.

  Researched answer:

The Arguments Object
JavaScript functions have a built-in object called the arguments object.

Best Ones I could find:

The argument object contains an array of the arguments used when the function was called (invoked).

arguments is an Array-like object accessible inside functions that contains the values of the arguments passed to that function.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: In proper pair programming, you would have two users two keyboards and mouses two monitors, and one computer. One programmer would be typing, as the Driver, while the other, the Navigator, gives direction as to where the code should go. Both programmers working together to solve the overall picture. 
  
  
  The Navigator would find the best steps for the driver to take which lets the driver focus on the code that is being typed and correct annotation. 

  The position of "Driver" and "Navigator" being switched off every so often to allow for both programmers to have an opportunity to give input and direction. 

  I also feel that switching off lets programmers get out of their head and refresh to have a clearer view of the outcome.  

  Researched answer:

Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.

6. What is iteration?

  Your answer: 

  Researched answer:
  iteration methods, which are methods that operate on every item in an array, one at a time. These methods are closely associated with loops.



7. What are advantages and disadvantages for using terminal commands to interact with your computer?

  Your answer: Terminal commands allow you to rudimentary information of directories and files. This also allows integration to git and other programming tools. A disadvantage would be the lack of gui with drag and drop or curser. 

  Researched answer:
The Terminal provides an efficient interface to access the true power of a computer better than any graphical interface. Using a terminal allows us to send simple text commands to our computer to do things like navigate through a directory or copy a file, and form the basis for many more complex automations and programming skills.


8. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: I think the best thing about this entire program is the about of time we dedicate to practice and challenges. It allows, at least me, to focus on what we just learned I just want to get better at taking notes to be able to get to the last stretch challenges.
